Top 10 countries by listener count

Streaming platform distribution (visualized by pie chart)

Average minutes streamed per day by age group

Most repeated song rate (calculated as minutes streamed per day divided by number of liked songs)

Most played artist overall

# Platform-Based Analysis:

Total and average minutes streamed per platform
